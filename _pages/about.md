I am a **Postdoctoral fellow** at **Politecnico di Torino** in Turin, Italy. 
I specialize in developing and applying advanced numerical techniques to solve **electromagnetic problems**.
I am also passionate about scientific computing and high-performance applications, with a strong focus on **C++** and experience in **MATLAB**, **Python**, and **Julia**.

I graduated with a **Ph.D.** (*cum Laude*) at Politecnico di Torino in **Electrical, Electronics and Communications Engineering**.
Prior to my doctoral studies, I graduated (cum laude) with a Master of Science (**MSc**) at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en) in **Computer Engineering**, and Master of Science (**MSc**) from [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/) in **Data Science and Engineering** (coursework and examinations completed at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr)), earned through a double degree program.

A list of my publications can be found in the [publication section](https://damianofranzo.github.io/publications/)

Since the beginning of my research activity, I have developed more than 5 fast [electromagnetic solvers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field_solver) (either in **MATLAB** or **C++**), for use in my published articles and ongoing research.
I am the main author of [open321](https://cerl-polito.github.io/Open321_pages/), a **C++** open-source library for matrix preconditioning for electromagnetics simulations. 
I also have contributed to [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org), a widely used **C++** linear-algebra open-source library, through several pull requests (PRs), by implementing some SIMD operations for complex-valued functions. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me by [email](mailto:damiano.franzo@polito.it) with any inquiries or collaboration proposals. 
You can find in the [resume section](https://damianofranzo.github.io/cv/) a detailed breakdown of my experiences and background.
